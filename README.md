# YamJS: Yet Another Minecraft JavaScript (Solution)

YamJS is a fork of Grakkit.

# Why a Fork?

The original implementation is in maintenance mode, which means it is no longer being actively developed or updated. This fork is our way of continuing to build on the great work that has already been done while also making it more relevant and useful for today's developers.

# Active Development

Please note that YamJS is currently in alpha and as such, there may be changes to the APIs and other aspects of the codebase as we continue to refine and improve it. While most APIs may be stable, it is possible that the next minor release may feature a breaking change during this phase.

# What will be different?

- Improved Developer Experience

  - Better Error Handling
  - Source Map Support
  - Improved Type Definition support

- TDB

# Conclusion

We are excited to share this fork of YamJS with the development community and believe that it represents a significant step forward in terms of quality, performance, and usability. We invite you to join us in building the next generation of software solutions and look forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions.
